This is an AI Reference Sheet, a global manifest for multiple knowledge files.
1.  **Purpose:** This file is an index linking a document's `DocID`, `Title`, and `Description` to its `SourceFile`. It does not contain document text.
2.  **Structure:** `[DocID: ... | Title: ... | Description: ...] | [SourceFile: ...]`
3.  **Usage:** Use this manifest to identify which `SourceFile` contains the relevant document for a query before retrieving the content. The Description field explains the document's purpose and content.
4.  **Canonical Identifier:** The `DocID` is the unique identifier.
